Chapter 12, Section 2.2 works through the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse (although it is not described as such, they instead present a rectangular pulse from the perspective of treating the function $f(t)=1$ as a time-limited signal). Compute the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse with different pulse widths (write a function that can accept different widths). Show that the Fourier transform goes towards an infinite pulse at 0 (this is called a delta function) as the width increases, by comparing the spectra for different pulse widths. [4 pts]\n",
